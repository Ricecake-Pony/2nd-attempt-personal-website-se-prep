# My Personal Website

This is my first website designed from scratch. It has taken well over 12 hours to get here but it looks pretty snazzy right?

The features within this page are:

1. A background-page color changing feature.
2. A countdown until graduation from the program.
3. Creating a navigation bar using tabs, that not only displays the corresponding information but also only displaying the "active" or clicked on tab, making it more dynamic.

Then different CSS designs throughout the page.

Thanks for coming by!
